# Machine-Learning
Credit card approval prediction using machine learning models.
Cleaned and explored data, addressing missing values, duplicates, and scaling features for model consistency; performed feature selection to identify the most relevant predictors for credit card approvals.
Applied and evaluated multiple machine learning models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the best-performing model.

Key Achievements:
	Improved model accuracy to approximately 87% using Random Forest.
	Integrated feedback to refine data handling and modelling approach.
	Developed robust methodology for predictive modelling, ensuring reproducibility and reliability of results.
